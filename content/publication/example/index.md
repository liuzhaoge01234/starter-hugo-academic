abstract: In the public safety service context, government big data governance
  (GBDG) is a challenging decision-making problem that encompasses uncertainties
  in the arenas of big data and its complex links. Modeling and collaborating
  the key scenario information required for GBDG decision-making can minimize
  system uncertainties. However, existing scenario-building methods are limited
  by their rigidity as they are employed in various application contexts and the
  associated high costs of modeling. In this paper, using a design science
  paradigm, a model-driven scenario modeling approach is proposed to achieve
  flexible scenario modeling for various applications through the transfer of
  generic domain knowledge. The key component of the proposed approach is a
  scenario meta-model that is built from existing literatures and practices by
  integrating qualitative, quantitative, and meta-modeling analysis. An
  instantiation mechanism of the scenario meta-model is also proposed to
  generate customized scenarios under Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC)
  theory. Two real-world safety service cases in Wuhan, China were evaluated to
  find that the proposed approach reduces GBDG decision-making uncertainties
  significantly by providing key information for GBDG problem identification,
  solution design, and solution value perception. This scenario-building
  approach can be further used to develop other GBDG systems for public safety
  services with reduced uncertainties and complete decision-making functions.
